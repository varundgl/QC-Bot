start_time	end_time	speaker	transcript
23.33	24.85	SPEAKER	OK you can switch on
36.77	37.29	SPEAKER	OK
40.41	49.81	SPEAKER	so here we are with a problem statement or the use case i can say not use case problem statement data overacting
52.62	76.45	SPEAKER	here we are on the google collab platform addressing our problem statement which involves google SDK indeed agent SDK as well so what do we do here we are trying to build AI agent using google SDK to automate real time web search tasks
79.74	100.69	SPEAKER	to automate real time web search tasks what's happening here what our objective we have to develop a simple autonomous AI agent that takes a user defined goal it performs a real time web search using google custom search API
102.37	218.41	SPEAKER	that is google SDK and presents relevant results to the user the agent should also retain memory of the past goals and result for reference so this is the objective and the problem statement basically we are trying to build an AI agent which will have a custom web search task on real time what are the key features of this it will accept the user defined goal that is a search query that's the prompt it will use google custom search API to fetch top search results that is the tool display the top three results including title URL and a snippet this is the result it will store the goal and results in the memory for future use also it will provide an option to refine the goal manually or conclude the session basically this is addressing in a manual perspective but serving the purpose of problem statement so these are the key features we'll be learning when we learn about this particular code then what is the expected outcome of this as i told you we have a goal we have a tool that is google custom search API action is results obtained then sorry action is nothing but searching for those particular top three results of the goal whatever it has been set and then displaying those three urls with title and snippet is the result then the real time search result delivered based on user inputs that's the
220.26	256.65	SPEAKER	expected outcome then a memory system that logs all goals and search outcomes during this session so this is the overall goal expected outcome and problem statement the features and objectives hope we are clear and set now let's understand the coding mic codes are generally very self explanatory so it's easy to understand indeed i'll also be explaining how does these things work
258.23	258.99	SPEAKER	here
260.58	292.06	SPEAKER	first what do we do we install the required package what is the package that is google API python client we are using pip install and we are trying to install the required package then we have to import certain modules so we have to import from google API client we import which is called build that's the module we are trying to build the AI agent right
293.69	311.45	SPEAKER	now in order to interact we should know two important things one API key you have to replace with your own API key when you are working this is my API key which has been set search engine ID
313.40	347.21	SPEAKER	that is google search engine ID you can replace that with your own so that's why i have mentioned in the comment replace these two keys accordingly OK then we are sorted with API configuration now the question is where do i find the API key and where do i find the search engine ID i'll quickly give you a walk through where you can find and how you can generate then we will proceed with the further code
502.81	504.21	SPEAKER	first time it's opening up
529.40	529.84	SPEAKER	is it
534.28	535.36	SPEAKER	count is only not set up
548.03	550.87	SPEAKER	hey i don't know who has money for API key
570.92	574.32	SPEAKER	there was so many API key
610.92	612.92	SPEAKER	non systemal
615.89	619.73	SPEAKER	we never get access to work in this now we have to show what i have to do i don't know
676.45	677.33	SPEAKER	finally
688.84	689.00	SPEAKER	OK
692.54	810.20	SPEAKER	let's understand how do we generate API key overall i'm just giving a gist of how do we do this first we have to go to google cloud there we have to select credentials once we select credentials you have an option to create credentials what kind of credential you can create let's see click on that you have different kinds of credentials available the first thing is API key click on the API key it will start creating your key ensure your particular API key is copied as and when it is created you can just copy this and paste it in a secure place right so once it's created you can close this if you want to see the API key you can just go show it OK if you want to see the API key you can click on show key it will show you that particular API key i'll close this if you want to edit something you can edit the API key here let's see what are the things we have here restrictions i have kept no restrictions if you want certain websites to be restricted or certain IP addresses restricted you can select them don't restrict key i have just put this across so it's by default i have not done anything it's just i've generated the API key and if you want to change the name you can change it here as well and save for now i'm not changing anything i'm just keeping as it is so you can copy that particular key go back and paste it here that is the API key now we have one more thing that is called search engine so what is the search engine ID where do we get this we will have a look at that as well
837.19	895.08	SPEAKER	you have to go to programmable search engine on google chrome you will get a screen like this if you want to create your search engine first time then it is sorry there is no search engines created here first time we are creating so we'll click on create your first search engine once you do this you can give a name for your search engine what are the different sites you want to list you can list individual pages as well you can also list the parts of a site as well so what i'm doing i'm keeping it universal i'm keeping it WWW dot google dot com so the complete google search engine is customized so now we will enable image search and save search both so don't forget to click on add here once you
898.00	953.64	SPEAKER	don't forget to OK so WWW dot google dot com OK do not forget to click on add here once you do this see you have your particular URL listed here the website generally so i'm not a robot i'll just click this and you press on create once you do that you can see a preview here it's in a format of script right HTML script so you go to customize once you go to customize you will get a search engine ID copy this if you want URL you have an URL as well which is also ending with the same search engine ID you can see both are almost same no sorry you can see both are same no
959.80	960.04	SPEAKER	OK
962.72	1026.20	SPEAKER	so what are the different search features enabled as by default it was image search safe search if you want to search the entire web you can toggle this as well if you want to see any advanced all features of settings you can see here so twenty enhancement if you want to add keywords specifically you can add it so you have all these features available if you want to restrict certain pages you can restrict basically you can enable a custom google search engine that is what i meant to say so i think you are clear with how do you get your search engine ID so i'm just going back again just showing you this yes it it is available the code format as well if you want to describe you can give a description too so i'm copying this and what do i do i come back to my code and paste it here OK
1040.03	1040.95	SPEAKER	OK that's it
1050.45	1052.33	SPEAKER	right there really it's
1070.26	1070.58	SPEAKER	let's see
1075.05	1080.25	SPEAKER	i'm showing them where they have to do this is my already set to code yeah i know
1082.41	1082.45	SPEAKER	i
1084.41	1087.05	SPEAKER	think i'll start
1095.12	1095.80	SPEAKER	need good data OK
1099.10	1140.28	SPEAKER	you have to just copy the search engine ID get back to your code and replace in the relevant page here right this is about the API configuration which you have to set hope we are clear with this step now let's proceed with the next steps memory to store past goals and results whatever you search with the help of your custom google SDK it has to be stored right for that you have to create a open space the memory space define the tool function using google SDK what is the tool function we have
1221.59	1249.74	SPEAKER	next you have to see how do you create a tool function using google SDK we have set a space in order to store our results now how it has to work with the help of what that is to be set so what are we doing we are searching google for the query whatever it has been given by the user and we will go to our custom search where we have integrated our API key
1267.02	1270.10	SPEAKER	i have to complete at least one course if not two
1306.79	1307.91	SPEAKER	pay my offensive day
