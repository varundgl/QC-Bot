3.07	4.15	SPEAKER	great grandmother
10.04	14.80	SPEAKER	hello all welcome to the session where we'll be learning regarding agent SDK
27.93	29.37	SPEAKER	i didn't i didn't take the
31.12	31.88	SPEAKER	slide deck only
50.39	54.03	SPEAKER	start
62.39	127.27	SPEAKER	hello all welcome to the session where we'll be learning regarding agent SDK what do we cover in this session let's understand with the help of the agenda first we will talk about what is agent SDK we will understand by definition what it is and how it will work next we have key components what are the elements which is truly required in order to make agent SDK work then we will see how does the working of agent SDK takes place later we will try to explore a use case with the code right what do we do there we will try to integrate agent SDK with google SDK and then we will code for a problem statement stay tuned to know what is that problem statement then we will be talking about the benefits and challenges of agent SDK right so why wait let's quickly start with the first topic
132.15	141.99	SPEAKER	introduction to agent SDK what does agent SDK actually it is a software development kit
143.51	186.23	SPEAKER	toolkit for building autonomous AI agents automatic workable AI agents can be generated with the help of agent SDK which will always provide a platform a resource and tools and libraries in order to develop these AI agents then it will also help to create a flexible and reusable AI systems later it is also helpful it will enable the integration of certain goals tools and memory in agents so all these kinds of help OK
188.75	261.67	SPEAKER	so agent SDK plays a very important role in order to build an AI agent so this is a brief intro about agent SDK let's understand the key components of agent SDK what are the key components do we have first goal meaning a human is giving prompt to the AI system that is the goal for the AI system the requirement received from the user end terms to be the goal for the agent then tools what are the tools it will involve in order to create a specified result a relevant result tools plays a important role than memory after finding the results where it will store obviously in the memory so memory is also a key component of agent SDK then reasoning loop the chat that happens between the agent and the human or the user
263.44	297.31	SPEAKER	this is reasoning loop first i will ask agent or AI system hi how are you i will get a response i'm good how can i help you from the agent right so this conversation will go on please list top AI trends for twenty twenty five is the goal for example what are the tools the web search it will make the integrated apis into that AI system plays a role of tool
298.83	323.15	SPEAKER	memory first it will store it will search it will store five to six courses or trends with respect to the artificial intelligence it will list back end it will be stored in the memory then after reasoning sorry then after storing what happens it will list the
325.32	340.68	SPEAKER	it will list the AI trends of twenty twenty five in the output screen once this is listed the user will try to change or tweak their particular prompt
342.53	347.76	SPEAKER	how they will change might be this time data science oriented trends
349.31	384.67	SPEAKER	they are asking for a second goal now and sometimes they might also ask out of six trends which you have listed which is the best so again it will go to a thinking mode this reasoning will go on loop until unless the user exits from the AI system this is just a common example which i try to give you in order to relate the key components of agent SDK next how does this agent SDK work that's more important to know
387.52	441.15	SPEAKER	first as i mentioned setting up a goal that is prompting once the agent receives the prompt it will decide what's the tool in need for example if i say please provide a simple program in order to add two numbers in python programming language so tool will be a python program right so next action it will try to write the code on behalf and it will try to display on the output screen which terms to be the result as simple as that it's not having much complicated elements involved we will prompt it will decide the tool the action will be taken and the result will be displayed this is a simple working of agent street
442.71	473.47	SPEAKER	now it's time to explore problem statement where it involves agent SDK and google SDK both of the use cases combined together in one program addressing one problem statement let's hop on to google collab and understand how the problem statement is listed and what is our solution how do we resolve the same let's quickly hop on to google platform
492.15	494.99	SPEAKER	window OK in the
498.96	503.28	SPEAKER	uh-huh i know usually that's the problem
505.03	511.23	SPEAKER	where is my chat OK oh it's right here OK i have to take it out
513.63	514.99	SPEAKER	no no what's the timing
516.74	519.47	SPEAKER	five minutes how
522.90	527.78	SPEAKER	then eight minutes i have time till twenty minutes
530.00	531.40	SPEAKER	one set will be twenty minutes
535.46	538.67	SPEAKER	stop my banana we will stop it and
