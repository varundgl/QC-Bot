5.22	47.15	SPEAKER	now let's continue with the benefits and challenges of agent SDK what are the benefits we have in agent SDK modularity as you saw there was certain modules very precise and clear goal is one module tool is one module results are one module memory is one module also we had looping that is another module so modularity plays a very important in agent SDK then reusability for that we had an example of how do we reuse the original code and integrate another element to it
49.12	68.72	SPEAKER	integration again i can give the same example we had first created a normal manual code then we tried integrating that to open API with the help of its API key integration is very easy so these three things the major benefits of using agent SDK now
70.63	98.87	SPEAKER	face with agent SDK in spite of having benefits we also have challenges first thing is tool chaining means integrating multiple tool into this SDK it would be difficult when the requirement of input is in one style and you get it in a different style the output differs so tool chaining is a problem is a challenge in agent SDK
100.43	120.87	SPEAKER	then debugging debugging an autonomous SDK is a little difficult because there's lots of elements to look through then key consideration maintaining the flexibility of agent SDK and also the complexity
122.65	139.63	SPEAKER	it is very difficult making the agent SDK a complex SDK and trying to make it flexible both hand in hand balancing this is little difficult that's a challenge that's the key consideration which you have to see
142.04	146.28	SPEAKER	hope we are clear with the benefits and the challenges of agent SDK
