5.42	101.75	SPEAKER	let's have a quick recap first we learnt what is agent SDK it's a framework or a toolkit which will help in order to create AI agents which is automatic in nature as simple as that then we saw key components that is goal memory tool and reasoning loop so these things play a very very important role when it comes to a agent SDK here goal is nothing but the objectives memory is storing the data tools are external sources in our example it was google SDK and the reasoning loop is the logic to any query that has been given to the agent it will decide the actions so we learned about this in a theoretical way also in a practical way then it allows agents in order to store the information interact with the tool make decisions and deliver the goal so achieving the goal automatically is one of the element which we saw next agent SDK provides an autonomy automatic nature modularity flexibility and task automation so this is the benefits which we saw and the challenges included integration debugging issues and managing exlan resources when it is integrated with agent SDK that would be little difficult
103.64	124.80	SPEAKER	so hope we are clear with what is agent SDK how does this work we also saw a use case a simple demo where we created custom google search with the help of google SDK hope this session was helpful we'll meet in the next one thank you
